#creators: K. Uha Priya, K. Sai Bharath, K. Sowmya, K. Prasad.

#aim: The main aim of this project is 
- To detect the presence of Neovascularisation on retinal surfaces. 
- To perform retinal vessel segmentation using Frangi vesselness filter for better results.
- To classify the given retinal images faster and accurately using Extreme Learning Machine classifier.

#abstract: 
- Diabetic retinopathy is a medical condition which when progresses to the advanced stage called Proliferative Diabetic retinopathy, results in the growth of new vessels in the retina. - This growth of abnormal vessels is called Neovascularization. 
- This work presents a novel algorithm to detect and classify Neovascularization as healthy, NVD, NVE using Extreme Learning Machine. 
- Initially, the Region of Interest is extracted using a binary mask. The resultant image is processed for the extraction of a retinal vessel map using Hessian based Frangi filter.
- For classification of the images, an optimal feature set of 14 features including seven-moment invariants is fed to the Extreme learning machine classifier.
- The proposed method obtains an average accuracy of 98% when tested on different globally accessible datasets.
